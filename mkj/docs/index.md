Hi! I’m Kaijing. My name carries the meaning of *lush growth and thriving energy* — and just like my name, I’m a cheerful, optimistic, and sunny girl.  I love many things that make life colorful: broadcasting & hosting, guzheng, Latin dance, and literature.  I'm curious by nature, always ready for challenges, and genuinely enjoy learning through both teamwork and self-driven exploration.

I’m currently applying for **PhD programs for Fall 2026**, and my current research interests include:

- *Evaluating the performance of LLMs*  
- *Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs*  
- *Understanding the underlying mechanisms of language models*

I am also enthusiastic about exploring **other areas in AI and computer science**, and I’m always excited to learn new topics and tackle novel challenges ✨ — for example: 🧠 reinforcement learning theory, 🤖 intelligent agents, 🎨 multimodal systems, 🧩 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, and 🏗️ model architectures.

For me, the core charm of AI research lies in turning the abstract idea of **“intelligence”** into something **buildable, measurable, explainable — and delightfully powerful**.

If you'd like to chat or collaborate — I’d love to hear from you! 💌
